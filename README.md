## Inroduction 

Every day, we encounter many different things to buy, especially online where we see lots of options in one category. Choosing can be hard. That's where 'reviews' come in. People who already bought a product give it a rating and write about their experience. Ratings help us quickly decide if something is good or bad. But for detailed reviews, we have to read everything to know if it's positive or negative. Nowadays, technology like Natural Language Processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence makes this easier.
